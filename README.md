# LG UltraWide 25UM58 25-inch IPS Monitor (2560 x 1080, 5ms, 250 cd/m2)
Here are my optimal settings for the [LG UltraWide 25UM58 25-inch IPS Monitor](https://amzn.to/2VjEetA).

## Entering the Advanced Setup Menu
This is used to adjust factory settings, bascailly we will be enabling FreeSync and adjusting colour tempertures. Then we will use the normal Settings Menu to adjust user preferences.

The aim to run the screen at around 75Hz and with better colour accuracy.

## Configuration on Windows
The monitor by default on my system doesn't display at the native 2560x1080 resolution. There wasn't even an option for it so I created one.

I used NVIDIA Control Panel to create a custom resolution. Open it and by right clicking the desktop and selecting NVIDIA Control Panel then select Change Resolution > Customise > Create Custom Resolution.

You may need to tick the box Enable resolutions not exposed by the display.
