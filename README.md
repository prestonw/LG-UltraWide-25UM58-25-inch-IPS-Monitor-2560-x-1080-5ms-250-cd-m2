# LG UltraWide 25UM58 25-inch IPS Monitor (2560 x 1080, 5ms, 250 cd/m2)
Here are my optimal settings for the [LG UltraWide 25UM58 25-inch IPS Monitor](https://amzn.to/2VjEetA).

## Entering the Service Menu
This is used to adjust factory settings, we will be enabling FreeSync (on a unsupported monitor) and adjusting colour tempertures. Then we will use the normal Settings Menu to adjust user preferences.

1. Power off, then power on
2. Push left 3 times, then right 1 time, and then press the joystick button
3. Then press left and select Menu to open the service menu.

1. Enable FreeSync settings by changing the MODEL OPTION to UM58A/UM59
2. No other service menu changes are necessary so power off, then power on.
3. Push the joystick button and press left to select the Menu.
4. Under Picture > Game Adjust > FreeSync turn it On.

The aim is to run the screen at around 75Hz and with better colour accuracy.

## Configuration on Windows
The monitor by default on my system doesn't display at the native 2560x1080 resolution. There wasn't even an option for it so I created one.

I used NVIDIA Control Panel to create a custom resolution. Open it and by right clicking the desktop and selecting NVIDIA Control Panel then select Change Resolution > Customise > Create Custom Resolution.

You may need to tick the box Enable resolutions not exposed by the display.
